This document summarizes comments received from contacts outside the \\n\\nFederal Reserve System and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. \\n\\n\\n\\nNational Summary      1  \\n\\n \\n\\nBoston   A-1 \\n\\nFirst District \\n\\n \\n\\nNew York   B-1 \\n\\nSecond District  \\n\\n \\n\\nPhiladelphia   C-1 \\n\\nThird District  \\n\\n \\n\\nCleveland   D-1 \\n\\nFourth District  \\n\\n \\n\\nRichmond   E-1 \\n\\nFifth District  \\n\\n \\n\\nAtlanta   F-1 \\n\\nSixth District  \\n\\n \\n\\nChicago   G-1 \\nSeventh District  \\n\\n \\n\\nSt. Louis   H-1 \\nEighth District  \\n\\n \\n\\nMinneapolis   I-1 \\nNinth District  \\n\\n \\n\\nKansas City   J-1 \\nTenth District \\n\\n \\n\\nDallas    K-1 \\nEleventh District \\n\\n \\n\\nSan Francisco  L-1 \\nTwelfth District \\n\\nWhat is the Beige Book? \\nThe Beige Book is a Federal Reserve System publication about current \\n\\neconomic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts. It charac-\\n\\nterizes regional economic conditions and prospects based on a variety \\nof mostly qualitative information, gathered directly f rom each District’s \\n\\nsources. Reports are published eight times per year. \\n\\nWhat is the purpose of the Beige Book? \\nThe Beige Book is intended to characterize the change in economic \\n\\nconditions since the last report. Outreach for the Beige Book is one of \\nmany ways the Federal Reserve System engages with businesses and \\n\\nother organizations about economic developments in their communi-\\n\\nties. Because this information is collected f rom a wide range of con-\\ntacts through a variety of formal and informal methods, the Beige Book \\n\\ncan complement other forms of regional information gathering. The \\n\\nBeige Book is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve \\nofficials. \\n\\nHow is the information collected? \\nEach Federal Reserve Bank gathers information on current economic \\n\\nconditions in its District through reports from Bank and Branch direc-\\n\\ntors, plus interviews and online questionnaires completed by business-\\nes, community organizations, economists, market experts, and other \\n\\nsources. Contacts are not selected at random; rather, Banks strive to \\ncurate a diverse set of sources that can provide accurate and objective \\n\\ninformation about a broad range of economic activities. The Beige \\n\\nBook serves as a regular summary of this information for the public. \\n\\nHow is the information used? \\nThe information f rom contacts supplements the data and analysis used \\nby Federal Reserve economists and staff to assess economic condi-\\n\\ntions in the Federal Reserve Districts. The qualitative nature of the \\n\\nBeige Book creates an opportunity to characterize dynamics and identi-\\nfy emerging trends in the economy that may not be readily apparent in \\n\\nthe available economic data. This information enables comparison of \\n\\neconomic conditions in different parts of the country, which can be \\nhelpful for assessing the outlook for the national economy. \\n\\nThe Beige Book does not have the type of information I’m looking \\n\\nfor. What other information is available? \\nThe Federal Reserve System conducts a wide array of recurring sur-\\n\\nveys of businesses, households, and community organizations. A list of \\n\\nstatistical releases compiled by the Federal Reserve Board is available \\nhere, links to each of the Federal Reserve Banks are available here, \\n\\nand a summary of the System’s community outreach is available here. \\n\\nIn addition, Fed Listens events have been held around the country to \\nhear about how monetary policy affects peoples’ daily lives and liveli-\\n\\nhoods.  The System also relies on a variety of advisory councils—\\n\\nwhose members are drawn f rom a wide array of businesses, non-profit \\norganizations, and community groups—to hear diverse perspectives on \\n\\nthe economy in carrying out its responsibilities. \\n\\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/data.htm\\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/structure-federal-reserve-banks.htm\\nhttps://www.fedcommunities.org/\\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-communications-fed-listens-events.htm\\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/advisorydefault.htm\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n1 \\n\\nNational Summary \\n\\nHighlights by Federal Reserve District \\n\\nOverall Economic Activity \\nThe national economy expanded at a moderate pace from early April to late May, a somewhat faster rate than the prior re-\\n\\nporting period. Several Districts cited the positive effects on the economy of increased vaccination rates and relaxed social \\n\\ndistancing measures, while they also noted the adverse impacts of supply chain disruptions. The effects of expanded vac-\\n\\ncination rates were perhaps most notable in consumer spending in which increases in leisure travel and restaurant spending \\n\\naugmented ongoing strength in other spending categories. Light vehicle sales remained solid but were often constrained by \\n\\ntight inventories. Factory output increased further even as significant supply chain challenges continued to disrupt production. \\n\\nManufacturers reported that widespread shortages of materials and labor along with delivery delays made it difficult to get \\nproducts to customers. Similar challenges persisted in construction. Homebuilders often noted that strong demand, buoyed \\n\\nby low mortgage interest rates, outpaced their capacity to build, leading some to limit sales. Nonresidential construction in-\\n\\ncreased at a moderate pace, on balance, even as contacts in several Districts said that supply chain disruptions pushed costs \\n\\nhigher and, in some cases, delayed projects. Demand for professional and business services increased moderately, while \\n\\ndemand for transportation services (including at ports) was exceptionally strong. Lending volumes increased modestly, with \\n\\ngains in both household and business loans. Overall, expectations changed little, with contacts optimistic that economic \\n\\ngrowth will remain solid. \\n\\nEmployment and Wages \\nStaffing levels increased at a relatively steady pace, with two-thirds of Districts reporting modest employment growth over the \\n\\nreporting period and the remainder indicating employment gains were moderate. As the spread of COVID-19 continued to \\n\\nslow, employment growth was strongest in food services, hospitality, and retail. Manufacturers also added workers in several \\nDistricts. It remained difficult for many firms to hire new workers, especially low-wage hourly workers, truck drivers, and \\n\\nskilled tradespeople. The lack of job candidates prevented some firms from increasing output and, less commonly, led some \\n\\nbusinesses to reduce their hours of operation. Overall, wage growth was moderate, and a growing number of firms offered \\n\\nsigning bonuses and increased starting wages to attract and retain workers. Contacts expected that labor demand will remain \\n\\nstrong, but supply constrained, in the months ahead. \\n\\nPrices \\nOn balance, overall price pressures increased further since the last report. Selling prices increased moderately, while input \\n\\ncosts rose more briskly. Input costs have continued to increase across the board, with many contacts noting sharp increases \\n\\nin construction and manufacturing raw materials prices. Increases were also noted in freight, packaging, and petrochemicals \\n\\nprices. Contacts reported that continuing supply chain disruptions intensified cost pressures. Strengthening demand, howev-\\n\\ner, allowed some businesses, particularly manufacturers, builders, and transportation companies, to pass through much of \\n\\nthe cost increases to their customers. Looking forward, contacts anticipate facing cost increases and charging higher prices in \\ncoming months. \\n\\nBoston \\nBusiness activity in the First District expanded at a moder-\\n\\nate pace. Restaurant sales were up sharply, and restaurant \\n\\nopenings buoyed retail property leasing. Labor demand \\n\\nstrengthened but hiring was held back by labor shortages. \\n\\nRecruiting efforts intensified, with varying degrees of wage \\n\\nincreases. Prices held mostly steady despite growing cost \\n\\npressures. \\n\\n \\n\\nNew York \\nThe regional economy continued to grow at a strong pace, \\n\\nwith growth broad-based across industries. Hiring picked up \\n\\nand wages continued to grow moderately, with availability of \\n\\nworkers cited as a top concern. Consumer spending and \\n\\ntourism picked up noticeably. Input price pressures have \\n\\nintensified further, and more businesses are raising their \\n\\nselling prices. \\n\\n \\n\\nThe Beige Book ■ May 2021 \\n\\n\\n\\n2 \\n\\nNational Summary \\n\\nPhiladelphia \\nBusiness activity continued at a moderate pace of growth \\n\\nduring the current Beige Book period – still below levels \\n\\nattained prior to the pandemic. Supply constraints contin-\\n\\nued to limit growth but may also be contributing to overstat-\\n\\ned perceptions of strong demand for labor and parts. Em-\\n\\nployment continued to grow modestly as did wage growth, \\n\\nwhile prices grew moderately. \\n\\nCleveland \\nThe pace of business activity quickened, and contacts \\n\\nexpect that demand will remain strong in the near term. \\n\\nHowever, supply chain bottlenecks constrained growth and \\ncaused materials costs to escalate. Price hikes became \\n\\nmore widespread as firms attempted to keep up with rising \\n\\ncosts. Hiring activity was reportedly modest because of a \\n\\ndearth of job applicants. A greater share of firms boosted \\n\\nwages, especially for hourly workers. \\n\\nRichmond \\nThe regional economy expanded moderately in recent \\n\\nweeks. Manufacturers and service providers reported in-\\n\\ncreased activity but also faced higher labor and input costs \\n\\nas well as shortages of materials. Employment rose moder-\\n\\nately but was constrained by challenges filling open posi-\\ntions. Prices rose briskly in recent weeks as some in-\\n\\ncreased costs of business were passed along to customers. \\n\\nAtlanta \\nEconomic activity expanded at a moderate pace. Labor \\nmarkets improved and wage pressures picked up for some \\n\\npositions. Some nonlabor costs remained elevated. Retail \\n\\nsales increased. Leisure, hospitality, and tourism activity \\n\\nstrengthened. Residential real estate demand remained \\n\\nstrong. Commercial real estate conditions were mixed. \\n\\nManufacturing activity improved. Banking conditions were \\n\\nsteady. \\n\\nChicago \\nEconomic activity increased moderately. Employment, \\n\\nconsumer spending, business spending, and manufacturing \\n\\nproduction all increased moderately, while construction and \\n\\nreal estate was flat. Wages and prices rose moderately and \\nfinancial conditions improved slightly. Prospects for agricul-\\n\\nture income in 2021 improved. \\n\\nSt. Louis \\nContacts reported that economic conditions have moderate-\\nly improved since our previous report. Many contacts de-\\n\\nscribed a situation in which growth in demand for their \\n\\nproducts or services is outpacing their growth in capacity. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMinneapolis \\nThe District economy saw robust demand, tempered by \\n\\ninventory shortages and rising prices. Job openings in-\\n\\ncreased, but wage growth was not well aligned with firms ’ \\n\\nbroader concerns over labor availability, and workforce \\n\\ncontacts cited low wages as a barrier to job seekers taking \\n\\navailable jobs. Manufacturing and construction activity \\n\\ncontinued to grow despite strong input cost pressures. \\nAgricultural incomes grew sharply. \\n\\nKansas City \\nEconomic activity rose moderately since the last survey. \\n\\nConsumer spending increased moderately, and sales were \\nabove pre-pandemic levels for the majority of retail, restau-\\n\\nrant, and auto contacts. Most other sectors expanded as \\n\\nwell, including commercial real estate, which increased for \\n\\nthe first time since the pandemic started. However, about \\n\\ntwo-thirds of firms reported a negative impact from rising \\n\\nmaterial prices and lack of availability. \\n\\nDallas \\nThe District economy expanded at a solid rate, bolstered by \\n\\ncontinued strong growth in housing, manufacturing, and \\n\\nnonfinancial services. Drilling activity rose further. Price \\n\\npressures intensified. Reports of labor shortages were more \\nwidespread across sectors and skill levels than the last \\n\\nreport. Outlooks stayed positive. \\n\\nSan Francisco \\nEconomic activity in the District expanded significantly, and \\nlabor market conditions continued to improve modestly. \\n\\nWages and inflation picked up further. Retail sales in-\\n\\ncreased, and activity in the services sector strengthened \\n\\nmoderately. Conditions in the manufacturing and agriculture \\n\\nsectors continued to improve. Residential construction \\n\\nremained strong, while lending activity grew somewhat. \\n\\n\\n\\nA-1 \\n\\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston \\n\\nSummary of Economic Activity \\n\\nBusiness activity in the First District expanded at a moderate pace on average, with notable variation across sectors. \\n\\nRestaurant sales were up sharply in recent months, surpassing their comparable 2019 levels. Automobile and home \\n\\nfurnishings sales were flat but at very high levels, and a discount retailer saw moderate sales increases. Most manufac-\\n\\nturers reported moderate to strong revenue increases, while two had flat but robust sales. Commercial real estate mar-\\n\\nkets were mostly stable but retail leasing increased notably. Residential real estate sales rose moderately as recent \\n\\ndata point to increased listings. Labor demand strengthened, but hiring was held back by widespread labor shortages. \\n\\nAmidst intensified recruiting efforts, wage increases varied across sectors. Prices held mostly steady despite growing \\n\\ncost pressures at some businesses, although restaurant prices rose sharply. Contacts generally maintained a cautiously \\n\\noptimistic outlook.  \\n\\nEmployment and Wages  \\nLabor demand strengthened but many firms reported \\n\\ndifficulties in hiring and retention. Staffing firms reported \\n\\nhigh demand for labor across a range of sectors. Retail \\n\\nheadcounts were level despite accelerating labor de-\\n\\nmand, as firms—especially restaurants—faced pro-\\n\\nnounced labor shortages. Manufacturers described \\n\\nambitious hiring goals: one planned to hire 10,000 work-\\n\\ners and another had open positions equal to more than \\n\\n10 percent of total staff. While the former firm did not \\n\\nanticipate market constraints on labor supply, other \\n\\nmanufacturers reported unusual difficulties finding work-\\n\\ners. In this context of higher labor demand, wage in-\\n\\ncreases were slight to moderate among manufacturers, \\n\\nwages for restaurant workers also went up, and selected \\n\\nhourly workers enjoyed wage increases of up to 30 \\n\\npercent. Signing bonuses and enhanced recruiting ef-\\n\\nforts were mentioned with increased frequency. Among \\n\\nthe barriers to labor supply, firms cited generous unem-\\n\\nployment benefits, childcare responsibilities, and safety \\n\\nconcerns. \\n\\nPrices  \\nHigh demand and low inventory in the auto industry led \\n\\nto modest price increases. A few manufacturers com-\\n\\nplained of further upward pressure on input prices—such \\n\\nas freight—but held back from raising prices in favor of \\n\\ncost-cutting measures. Others manufacturers reported \\n\\nno substantive pricing pressures. In Massachusetts, \\n\\nrestaurant prices increased sharply to cover increased \\n\\nlabor and food costs, and a furniture retailer faced in-\\n\\ncreased wholesale pricing pressure but did not report \\n\\nany price increases. Staffing bill rates were either flat or \\n\\nup slightly. \\n\\nRetail and Tourism \\nAccording to contacts, since March retail sales were \\n\\nstable or moderately higher and restaurant sales surged, \\n\\nwhile through March hotel occupancy rates showed little \\n\\nimprovement from winter. New and used automobile \\n\\nsales were roughly steady at a very strong pace, strain-\\n\\ning inventories. The scarcity of processing chips contin-\\n\\nued to restrain production at some carmakers, threaten-\\n\\ning an otherwise strong market for 2021. A salvaged \\n\\ngoods chain reported moderately increased sales in \\n\\nrecent months, with revenues up 6 percent from the \\n\\nsame period in 2019. Online sales of home furnishings \\n\\nremained robust and sales of outdoor furniture increased \\n\\nearlier in the season than expected. A contact perceives \\n\\nthat the market for outdoor furniture expanded in the \\n\\npandemic and will stay strong.  \\n\\nRestaurants across Massachusetts experienced a dra-\\n\\nmatic uptick in sales in April and May, with recent reve-\\n\\nnues exceeding those in the same period of 2019. April \\n\\nalso brought the reopening of the majority of the roughly \\n\\n500-700 restaurants in the state that temporarily closed \\n\\nover the winter. The return of widespread outdoor dining \\n\\nfueled the initial surge in sales, but more recently dining \\n\\nroom sales increased as well. Conventions in Boston \\n\\nThe Beige Book ■ May 2021 \\n\\n\\n\\nA-2 \\n\\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston   \\n\\nremain canceled through the fall, but major outdoor \\n\\nevents slated for October—including the Boston Mara-\\n\\nthon—are anticipated to bring large numbers of visitors \\n\\nto the area. As of March hotel occupancy rates in greater \\n\\nBoston stood at around 25 percent, similar to the previ-\\n\\nous report, but contacts remain optimistic for summer \\n\\ntourism.  \\n\\nManufacturing and Related Services  \\nOf the eight firms contacted this cycle, six reported mod-\\n\\nerate to strong revenue gains in 2021Q1 from the previ-\\n\\nous quarter and two said that sales were roughly flat. All \\n\\nreported higher sales versus the same period a year \\n\\nago. Year-over-year growth was exceptionally strong for \\n\\nsuppliers to the semiconductor and health care indus-\\n\\ntries, respectively, and a provider of diagnostic services \\n\\nto veterinarians also reported strong sales increases \\n\\nfrom one year ago. These results were not distorted by \\n\\npandemic-related declines in 2020. Two firms that re-\\n\\nported being inundated with orders pointed out that \\n\\ncustomers were placing the same order with multiple \\n\\nsuppliers, and so felt that results were perhaps inflated \\n\\nrelative to true demand.   \\n\\nContacts cited two main limits to growth: labor scarcity \\n\\nand supply chain issues. The dearth of semiconductors \\n\\nremains a major problem, but contacts also cited long \\n\\nlead times for a variety of other inputs. Supply con-\\n\\nstraints held back production for some contacts, but \\n\\nmost were able to meet their output goals and none \\n\\nmade major revisions to their capital expenditures plans. \\n\\nAll contacts were optimistic for the rest of 2021 and \\n\\nsome revised their forecasts up. All anticipated relaxing \\n\\nany remaining COVID restrictions over the summer.  \\n\\nStaffing Services \\nFirst District staffing firms reported mixed results ranging \\n\\nfrom modest revenue declines to robust gains in the first \\n\\nquarter of 2021 from the previous quarter. Two out of \\n\\nfour firms said that 2021Q1 had been their strongest \\n\\nquarter since before the pandemic, with sales increases \\n\\nas high as 28 percent. Firms described labor demand as \\n\\nrobust across most fields, and especially strong for direct \\n\\nhires in skilled positions. Conversions from temporary to \\n\\npermanent employment increased. Contacts expressed \\n\\ngrowing concerns about weak labor supply, but one said \\n\\nthere was an ongoing surplus of low-skilled workers. \\n\\nOne firm reported sharply higher pay rates for selected \\n\\npositions and said that the higher rates reflected a com-\\n\\nbination of labor scarcity and growing business confi-\\n\\ndence. Other firms launched new recruiting campaigns \\n\\nto combat labor scarcity. Some contacts perceived that \\n\\ngenerous unemployment benefits were the deciding \\n\\nfactor holding back labor supply, but others expected at \\n\\nleast a modest boost in labor supply as vaccination rates \\n\\nclimbed and infection rates declined.  \\n\\nCommercial Real Estate \\nCommercial real estate markets in the First District were \\n\\nstable or improving. Robust demand for warehouse \\n\\nspace amid low inventories translated into very rapid \\n\\nsales of listed properties. Industrial construction was \\n\\nseen as still profitable despite high construction costs, \\n\\nbut some contacts warned that further cost increases \\n\\ncould become prohibitive. Life sciences construction \\n\\nplans expanded moderately to include Rhode Island, \\n\\ndespite remaining concentrated in the Boston area. \\n\\nContacts were encouraged by fresh gains in retail leas-\\n\\ning activity, due to a spate of openings and relaunches of \\n\\nrestaurants and smaller stores, but noted that large-\\n\\nformat retail leasing remained weak. Office leasing \\n\\nshowed no signs of improvement and the outlook for \\n\\neventual office occupancy rates and rents remains un-\\n\\ncertain. Contacts expect to have a clearer picture of the \\n\\noffice market after Labor Day, which is when many firms \\n\\nare expected to bring greater numbers of workers back \\n\\nto the office.  \\n\\nResidential Real Estate \\nResidential real estate markets posted robust sales and \\n\\nfurther price increases to March and April 2021, with \\n\\ngrowing strength in condominium sales. Vermont report-\\n\\ned changes from March 2020 to March 2021 while all \\n\\nother reporting areas provided changes from April 2020 \\n\\nto April 2021; Connecticut data were unavailable.  \\n\\nClosed sales, pending sales, and median sales prices \\n\\nincreased by moderate-to-large margins over-the-year in \\n\\nall reporting areas, indicating a moderate acceleration in \\n\\nactivity since the previous report. Condominium sales \\n\\nshowed particular strength, with pending condo sales up \\n\\nmore than 100 percent in all reporting markets. However, \\n\\nthe outsized over-the-year sales gains in part reflect the \\n\\nlow sales levels in March and April of 2020, when the \\n\\nmarket was on pause due to COVID-19. As in the last \\n\\nreport, homes for sale are down by double digit percent-\\n\\nages for all reporting markets, although the Boston con-\\n\\ndo market saw a moderate increase in supply. Although \\n\\ncontacts continued to worry about low inventories, the \\n\\nMassachusetts contact pointed out a substantial in-\\n\\ncrease in listings in April, and some expected a seasonal \\n\\nincrease in listings in the coming months.■ \\n\\nFor more information about District economic conditions visit: \\nwww.bostonfed.org/regional-economy  \\n\\n\\n\\nB-1 \\n\\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York \\n\\nSummary of Economic Activity \\nEconomic activity in the Second District continued to grow strongly in the latest reporting period, as vaccinations ex-\\npanded and COVID cases abated across the District. Business contacts expressed widespread optimism about the near\\n-term outlook. The labor market has strengthened further, with contacts reporting increased employment and wages, as \\nwell as difficulties hiring and retaining staff. Input price pressures have intensified further, and more businesses report \\nthat they are raising their selling prices. Consumer spending has strengthened, bolstered by accelerating auto and retail \\nsales and rising tourism. Housing markets have been steady to stronger, while markets for office and retail space ap-\\npear to have stabilized at weak levels. Finally, contacts in the broad finance sector reported moderate improvement in \\nconditions, while regional banks reported higher loan demand and little change in delinquency rates.   \\n\\nEmployment and Wages  \\nThe job market strengthened further in recent weeks, \\nwith more businesses reporting a pickup in employment \\nand widespread labor shortages. A major New York City \\nemployment agency noted a significant increase in hiring \\nand a greater sense of urgency to fill open positions. \\nSimilarly, an upstate employment agency noted in-\\ncreased hiring activity for both payroll and contract work-\\ners and indicated that filling job openings have been \\nchallenging. Many business contacts ranked staffing as \\na top business concern, especially at the lower end of \\nthe wage spectrum, and attributed this to a combination \\nof workers’ health concerns, child-care constraints, and \\ngenerous unemployment benefits. \\n\\nA broad array of businesses plans to add staff in the \\ncoming months—particularly those engaged in leisure & \\nhospitality, manufacturing, retail, and wholesale trade. A \\nmajor employment services firm expects the tight labor \\nmarket to intensity, as businesses bring staff back to the \\noffice and many workers are looking to change jobs. \\n\\nWages have continued to grow moderately, with espe-\\ncially widespread increases in the retail and wholesale \\ntrade sectors. Looking ahead, a substantial proportion of \\nbusinesses across all major industry sectors plan to \\nraise wages. \\n  \\n\\nPrices \\nFirms’ input prices have continued to accelerate across \\nthe board, with an overwhelming majority of contacts in \\nconstruction and manufacturing noting increases. Busi-\\nnesses in all sectors expect widespread hikes in prices \\nthey pay in the months ahead. \\n\\nSelling prices accelerated modestly, with hikes widely \\nreported in manufacturing, retail, wholesale trade, and \\ntransportation but steady prices in most other sectors. \\nThe vast majority of manufacturers, retailers, wholesal-\\ners, and transportation firms plan price hikes in the \\nmonths ahead. More moderate increases were anticipat-\\ned in other industry sectors. Uncertainty about future \\ninflation was also cited as a concern in planning and \\nformulating contracts.    \\n\\nConsumer Spending \\nConsumer spending picked up to a strong pace of \\ngrowth in recent weeks. Non-auto retailers reported a \\nsubstantial increase in business, with some reports of a \\nsharp rebound in demand for luggage and formal wear. \\nA major retail chain noted that its sales in the region \\nhave exceeded plan, though sales in New York City \\ncontinued to lag, partly due to weak international tour-\\nism. Retailers also expressed increasing optimism about \\nthe near-term outlook. Consumer confidence among \\n\\nThe Beige Book ■ May 2021 \\n\\n\\n\\nB-2 \\n\\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York   \\n\\nNew York State residents surged to a two-year high. \\n\\nSales of both new and used vehicles have strengthened \\nnoticeably since the last report, far surpassing pre-\\npandemic levels, despite low inventories. However, a \\npersistent shortage of microchips is expected to keep \\ninventories lean for a number of months, and this is \\nexpected to severely restrain new vehicle sales. Dealers \\nreported that credit availability continues to be satisfacto-\\nry.       \\n\\nManufacturing and Distribution \\nActivity continued to grow strongly in the manufacturing \\nand wholesale trade sectors but slowed somewhat in \\ntransportation & warehousing. Contacts continued to \\nreport widespread supply disruptions and delays at ports \\nand in trucking. Looking ahead, businesses in all these \\nsectors continued to express widespread optimism about \\nnear-term business prospects, despite ongoing concerns \\nabout the future availability of workers and materials.   \\n\\nServices \\nService industry contacts also reported sturdy growth in \\nthe latest reporting period. Contacts in the hard-hit lei-\\nsure & hospitality sector noted exceptionally strong gains \\nin business activity. Businesses in the information, pro-\\nfessional & business services, and education & health \\nsectors all noted a continuation of fairly brisk growth.  \\nLooking to the months ahead, contacts in all these sec-\\ntors expressed widespread optimism about business \\nprospects.  \\n\\nTourism has strengthened further, particularly in New \\nYork City, though the volume of international and busi-\\nness visitors has remained well below pre-pandemic \\nlevels. In New York City, hotel occupancy rates have \\ncontinued to rise, exceeding 50 percent for the first time \\nsince before the pandemic, with weekend occupancy \\nrates noticeably higher. Nightly room rates have risen \\nbut remained well below normal levels. Moreover, as \\nrestrictions have been lifted, a number of New York City \\nhotels have re-opened, and the city has waived the hotel \\noccupancy tax for the third quarter of this year. Museums \\nand restaurants have also seen a rebound in business.  \\n\\nReal Estate and Construction \\nHousing markets continued to strengthen in the latest \\nreporting period. Sales markets outside of Manhattan \\nhave remained quite robust, with rising sales volume, \\nlean inventories, strong price appreciation, and frequent \\n\\nbidding wars. In Manhattan, sales volume has picked up \\nstrongly, while the inventory of homes for sale has re-\\nceded somewhat from the peak levels of last October but \\nremains higher than normal. Prices have stabilized at \\nabout 6 percent below pre-pandemic levels.     \\n\\nNew York City’s rental market remains soft but appears \\nto have hit bottom. Rents in Manhattan are still down \\nroughly 20 percent from early-2020 level and down 10-\\n15 percent in Brooklyn and Queens. However, leasing \\nactivity has picked up substantially across the city reach-\\ning the highest levels in well over a decade. A local real \\nestate expert ascribes this largely to more people mov-\\ning for better deals.    \\n\\nCommercial real estate markets have remained mixed \\nacross the District but have shown signs of stabilizing \\noverall. Office markets in and around New York City \\ncontinued to slacken, with vacancy and availability rates \\ncontinuing to trend up and rents steady but moderately \\nbelow year-earlier levels in Manhattan and modestly \\nbelow across the rest of the metro region. Office markets \\nacross upstate New York have been steady. The market \\nfor retail space has stabilized, with scattered signs of a \\npickup in some areas. The industrial market remains \\nfairly robust, with vacancy rates steady at low levels and \\nrents up 5-10 percent from a year earlier.   \\n\\nNew office construction has remained sluggish, but \\nmultifamily residential construction has picked up outside \\nNew York City. Contacts in the District’s construction \\nindustry have grown somewhat more positive about \\ncurrent conditions and substantially more optimistic \\nabout the near-term outlook, though there is widespread \\nconcern about the cost and availability of materials, \\nespecially lumber, and workers.  \\n\\nBanking and Finance \\nBusinesses in the broad finance sector noted moderate \\nimprovement in business activity. Bankers reported a \\npickup in loan demand, mainly from the commercial \\nsector. Credit standards were unchanged, except on \\nresidential mortgages where bankers tightened stand-\\nards. Loan spreads were little changed. Delinquency \\nrates were generally flat overall—down modestly for C&I \\nloans, but up somewhat for residential mortgages. Banks \\nreported that they have become less lenient toward \\ndelinquent accounts, except for commercial mortgages.■ \\n\\nFor more information about District economic conditions visit:  \\nwww.newyorkfed.org/regional‐economy \\n\\n\\n\\nC-1 \\n\\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia \\n\\nSummary of Economic Activity \\n\\nOn balance, business activity in the Third District continued to grow moderately during the current Beige Book period; \\n\\nhowever, activity in most sectors remained below levels observed prior to the pandemic. The share of adults who have \\n\\nreceived at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine has climbed well past 50 percent. As normal activity resumes, con-\\n\\ntacts have reported increasing demand. However, labor shortages and supply chain disruptions have also continued. \\n\\nSome contacts observed that some of the perceived strong demand may represent the broader (duplicative) search \\n\\nefforts of employers for labor and producers for parts. On the housing front, an overly hot market may be discouraging \\n\\nbuyers. Net employment continued at a modest pace of growth, while wages and prices continued to grow modestly and \\n\\nmoderately, respectively. About two-thirds of the firms expressed positive expectations for continued growth over the \\n\\nnext six months – broadening among nonmanufacturers but narrowing among manufacturers since the prior period. \\n\\nEmployment and Wages  \\nEmployment continued to grow modestly overall. The \\n\\nshare of firms reporting employment increases broad-\\n\\nened to one-third among nonmanufacturers, while re-\\n\\nported increases edged back to one-fourth among manu-\\n\\nfacturing firms. Overall, average hours worked rose \\n\\nagain but for a smaller share of all firms.  \\n\\nNearly all firms reported difficulty hiring sufficient labor. \\n\\nContacts at staffing firms reported ongoing demand for \\n\\nworkers, unusually high levels of open orders, and a \\n\\ndearth of qualified job candidates. While demand clearly \\n\\nexceeds the supply, contacts did note that perceived \\n\\ndemand may be overstated by clients placing orders with \\n\\nmore staffing firms than is typical.  \\n\\nWages continued to rise modestly. The percentage of \\n\\nnonmanufacturing firms reporting higher wage and bene-\\n\\nfit costs per employee edged above one-third, while the \\n\\nshare reporting lower wages remained very low. Prior to \\n\\nthe pandemic, the share of firms reporting compensation \\n\\nincreases averaged well over one-third. Across all sec-\\n\\ntors, firms continued to report raising wages and offering \\n\\nsigning bonuses, retention bonuses, and referral bonus-\\n\\nes to compete for scarce labor resources.  \\n\\n \\n\\nPrices  \\nOn balance, prices continued to rise moderately over the \\n\\nperiod. The share of manufacturers reporting higher \\n\\nprices for factor inputs remained at about three-fourths, \\n\\nwhile those receiving higher prices for their own products \\n\\nrose well above one-third. In turn, the share of nonmanu-\\n\\nfacturers reporting higher prices for their inputs rose to \\n\\none-half; however, the share receiving higher prices from \\n\\nconsumers for their own goods and services fell to one-\\n\\nfifth.  \\n\\nContacts continued to note severe supply chain disrup-\\n\\ntions impacting most sectors of the economy. Microchip \\n\\nshortages continued to limit current and future produc-\\n\\ntion plans, and container shortages continued to disrupt \\n\\nlogistics.  \\n\\nLooking ahead one year, the prices that firms anticipate \\n\\nreceiving for their own goods and services rose further \\n\\nstill – after the firms reported moderately high expecta-\\n\\ntions last quarter. Firm expectations for compensation \\n\\nincreases were slightly higher than those for their own \\n\\nprices, and expectations of general consumer price \\n\\nincreases rose the most. Unlike in prior quarters, firms \\n\\nnow expect general consumer inflation to be even higher \\n\\nthan firm prices.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThe Beige Book ■ May 2021 \\n\\n\\n\\nC-2 \\n\\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia   \\n\\nManufacturing \\nOn average, manufacturing activity continued growing \\n\\nmoderately. About 40 percent of the firms reported that \\n\\nincreases of shipments and new orders were somewhat \\n\\nhigher. On net, manufacturing activity remained below \\n\\npre-pandemic levels.  \\n\\nAs with perceived demand at staffing firms, many manu-\\n\\nfacturers have stated that their production would be \\n\\nhigher but for labor shortages and supply chain disrup-\\n\\ntions. A good portion of the perceived demand appears \\n\\nto be real, as order backlogs, inventories, and delivery \\n\\ntimes increased further and were at or near record levels \\n\\nin May.  \\n\\nConsumer Spending \\nContacts reported continued modest growth of nonauto \\n\\nretail sales. Survivors in the retail and restaurant sectors \\n\\nare reporting strong sales and profits even against 2019 \\n\\nlevels. Rising vaccination rates and an anticipated return \\n\\nto “normal” are feeding positive expectations for the \\n\\nremainder of the year.  \\n\\nReports from auto dealers suggest that sales grew mod-\\n\\nerately. In some markets, year-to-date sales now equal \\n\\ntheir 2019 sales for the comparable period. Some con-\\n\\ntacts suggested that buyers may have hastened recent \\n\\npurchases to avoid an anticipated decline in dealer in-\\n\\nventory as manufacturers contend with the microchip \\n\\nshortage. Despite the tightening constraint on new car \\n\\nsales, stronger used car sales and higher prices have \\n\\nboosted profit margins.  \\n\\nOverall, tourism continued to grow modestly – reflecting \\n\\na slow recovery as more potential leisure travelers are \\n\\nvaccinated. Consumers have pent-up demand for travel \\n\\nexperiences, and many have extra savings to spend.  \\n\\nContacts also noted improvements in business travel but \\n\\ndon’t expect a full recovery this year or next.  \\n\\nNonfinancial Services \\nOn balance, nonmanufacturing activity continued at a \\n\\nmoderate pace of growth. Over one-third of the firms \\n\\nreported increases in sales or revenues; however, most \\n\\nfirms continued to note that output remains below pre-\\n\\npandemic levels. \\n\\nFinancial Services \\nThe volume of bank lending fell slightly during the period \\n\\n(not seasonally adjusted); compared with the same \\n\\nperiod in 2019, by contrast, loan volumes grew modestly. \\n\\nCommercial and industrial loans, home equity lines, and \\n\\nother consumer loans fell moderately, while auto lending \\n\\nfell slightly. Commercial real estate lending grew, but \\n\\nonly slightly, while home mortgages were flat. Credit \\n\\ncard volumes were also flat – in contrast, volumes grew \\n\\nat a modest pace over the same period in 2019.  \\n\\nBankers, accountants, and bankruptcy attorneys contin-\\n\\nued to report that relatively few problems with bad debt \\n\\nhad emerged. Optimism had grown for many of their \\n\\nclients in recent weeks; however, some creditors and \\n\\nlandlords have become impatient to collect, evict, or \\n\\nforeclose. A credit counselor reported increasing activity \\n\\nto fix credit scores for prospective first-time homebuyers, \\n\\nto keep current homeowners in their houses, and to \\n\\nconsider personal bankruptcy options.  \\n\\nAn accountant reported more mergers and acquisitions, \\n\\nwith some clients choosing to sell their businesses – \\n\\ngiving reasons of retirement, uncertainty, stress, and \\n\\nhigh valuations as motivating factors. A corporate lawyer \\n\\nnoted that a few smaller clients had simply paid their \\n\\ndebts and closed down their businesses.  \\n\\nReal Estate and Construction \\nHomebuilders reported modest growth in new contracts \\n\\nas sales traffic slowed, yet construction activity contin-\\n\\nued apace. Contacts noted that higher prices and ex-\\n\\ntended delivery times have dissuaded some buyers, \\n\\nwhile builders remain challenged by the high costs of \\n\\nbuilding materials, ongoing supply chain disruptions, and \\n\\nthe unreliability of subcontractor scheduling.  \\n\\nExisting home sales were flat, as new listings continued \\n\\nto fall – availability dropped below a one-month supply in \\n\\nmany locations. In the face of ongoing demand, contacts \\n\\nnoted a strong sellers’ market in which offers were often \\n\\nabove asking price, in all cash, or without inspections or \\n\\nother buyer protections. One contact noted that some \\n\\npotential buyers were giving up, while others commented \\n\\non the rising unaffordability, especially for buyers who \\n\\nqualify for FHA but not conventional financing.  \\n\\nPhiladelphia’s commercial construction activity appeared \\n\\nto have improved slightly to 85 or 90 percent of pre-\\n\\npandemic levels. Little change was evident in nonresi-\\n\\ndential leasing activity, although reports of future office \\n\\ndownsizing continued to grow. Demand for warehouse \\n\\nspace remained strong, and the weak supply of for-sale \\n\\nhomes appears to be boosting demand for rental units. ■ \\n\\nFor more information about District economic conditions visit:  \\nwww.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/regional-\\neconomy \\n\\n\\n\\nD-1 \\n\\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland \\n\\nSummary of Economic Activity \\nThe economic recovery gained strength in recent weeks, and contacts across an array of industries reported healthy \\ngains in customer demand. Contacts often pointed to progress in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, the easing \\nof government-mandated restrictions, and the release of pent-up demand as key drivers of the recent improvement in \\ncustomer demand. For these same reasons, firms were decidedly upbeat that demand will continue to improve in the \\nnear-term. That said, many contacts commented that supply chain bottlenecks were constraining growth by causing \\nextended lead times, depleted inventories, and escalating materials and transportation costs. Hiring activity was report-\\nedly modest despite the improvement in customer demand, and many firms indicated they were operating with fewer \\nstaff members than they would like because of a dearth of job applicants. Consequently, a greater share of firms boost-\\ned wages, particularly for hourly workers on the lower end of the pay scale. Price hikes became more widespread as \\nfirms attempted to keep up with rising costs for materials and labor.  \\n\\nEmployment and Wages  \\nStaff levels increased modestly, despite widespread \\nreports that customer demand had strengthened. Many \\nfirms commented that their headcounts were below \\ndesired levels because there were too few applicants for \\nopen positions. The problem was acute for firms in con-\\nsumer-facing industries. A few retailers and restaurants \\nnoted they operated with reduced hours or had closed \\nlocations because they were short-staffed. One conven-\\nience store chain tried to increase its staff level for the \\npast month, but unsuccessfully. As a result, 10 of its \\nstores operated for four fewer hours than desired each \\nday. Many manufacturers also said they were short-\\nstaffed, and several noted they were using overtime to fill \\nthe staffing gap. Others indicated that they were auto-\\nmating processes to keep up with demand and to reduce \\nlabor needs. Contacts in several industries observed an \\nincrease in employee turnover, which they attributed to \\nworkers’ feeling more confident leaving their jobs for \\nhigher wages or for more suitable positions.  \\n\\nThe dearth of available workers motivated a greater \\nshare of firms to raise wages. About 55 percent of our \\nsurvey respondents increased wages over the past two \\nmonths, up from about 40 percent in the prior period. \\nReports of wage increases were widespread and were \\nespecially common among manufacturing, retail, and \\n\\nfreight contacts. One staffing company contact remarked \\nthat he turned away prospective clients that offered \\nstarting wages of less than $13 per hour because he will \\nnot be able to find anyone at that wage. \\n\\nPrices  \\nReports of rising input costs have grown more wide-\\nspread. About three-fourths of contacts reported that \\ntheir nonlabor costs had increased in the last two \\nmonths. This share is up from about two-thirds in the last \\nreport. Cost increases were broad across items and \\nwere especially sharp for resins, metals, lumber, packag-\\ning, and freight services. Rising input costs were partly \\nattributed to supply chain challenges caused by suppli-\\ners who often did not have enough workers to meet \\ndemand. A few manufacturing and construction firms \\nreported that suppliers were raising their prices more \\nfrequently. One real estate developer said that quotes \\nfrom general contractors were now valid for only 10 \\ndays, whereas before the pandemic quotes would be \\nvalid for 30 days or even as many as 180 days. Looking \\nto the second half of 2021, roughly 60 percent of con-\\ntacts expect their nonlabor costs will increase by an \\namount comparable to or more than the increases they \\nexperienced in the first half of 2021.  \\n\\nReports of firms’ raising their selling prices also became \\n\\nThe Beige Book ■ May 2021 \\n\\n\\n\\nD-2 \\n\\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland   \\n\\nmore widespread. Many of the firms that raised prices \\nsuggested they were able to pass through most of their \\ncost increases to customers. Contacts now expect it to \\ntake longer than previously anticipated for these supply \\nchain issues to be resolved. This expectation motivated \\nsome of them to be more aggressive with their pricing. \\nLooking ahead, about half of contacts plan to raise their \\nselling prices in the second half of the year, with most of \\nthose firms intending to do so to an extent that will at \\nleast preserve their margins.   \\n\\nConsumer Spending \\nReports suggest that consumer spending grew signifi-\\ncantly. General merchandisers and apparel retailers said \\nthat demand remained strong beyond the expected \\nboost from stimulus funds in March. Several contacts \\nbelieved there was a good deal of pent-up demand that \\nwas being released as government restrictions were \\nbeing eased. Hoteliers reported improvements in leisure \\ntravel, and auto dealers commented that sales were \\nstrong despite limited inventory and higher selling prices. \\nContacts were optimistic that consumer spending would \\ncontinue to improve in the coming months thanks to \\ngrowing vaccination numbers and easing of government-\\nmandated restrictions.   \\n\\nManufacturing \\nDemand for manufactured goods continued to increase \\nstrongly. Contacts cited strength in demand for products \\nrelated to housing, autos, and other durable consumer \\ngoods. Aerospace-related production continued its mod-\\nest recovery, although demand remained weak on bal-\\nance. Many contacts noted that output growth was con-\\nstrained by shortages of hourly-wage workers, extended \\nlead times for inputs, and depleted inventories. Many \\ncontacts reported their capacity utilization was within its \\nnormal range, although a sizeable minority reported \\nabove-normal capacity utilization. Manufacturers gener-\\nally expected demand to continue to rise in coming \\nmonths. \\n\\nReal Estate and Construction \\nDemand for residential construction and real estate \\nremained elevated as homebuyers continued to take \\nadvantage of low mortgage interest rates. Even so, a few \\ncontacts remarked that escalating construction costs \\nmay have sapped some of the momentum in homebuild-\\ning. One homebuilder observed that elevated prices \\nmade some customers hesitant to move forward with \\nprojects. A realtor observed a slowdown in lot purchases \\nas builders in her market waited for construction prices \\nto settle. Expectations for demand were mixed. Some \\ncontacts believed that housing demand would remain \\n\\nstrong, while others predicted that elevated prices would \\ndiscourage potential homebuyers.  \\n\\nNonresidential construction and real estate activity in-\\ncreased in nearly all sectors as workers began to return \\nto their offices, more consumers resumed in-store shop-\\nping, and overall economic conditions continued to im-\\nprove. Overall, nonresidential contacts were optimistic \\nthat demand would increase further as the economy \\ncontinues to reopen and pent-up demand is released. \\nHowever, one contractor suggested that rising prices \\nand materials shortages may curtail construction.  \\n\\nFinancial Services \\nBanking activity increased moderately. Contacts noted \\nthat demand for auto loans and mortgages remained \\nstrong, although the recent uptick in interest rates and \\nlimited inventories in both markets dampened activity. \\nMultiple contacts reported improvements in business \\nlending, especially for commercial real estate loans. \\nHowever, overall loan demand remained relatively soft. \\nLenders said that delinquency rates for consumer and \\ncommercial loans were still low and that the number of \\nactive forbearance agreements continued to drop. Bank-\\ners were optimistic that loan demand would continue to \\npick up as social distancing restrictions ease, but they \\nalso noted that potentially higher interest rates clouded \\ntheir outlooks. They were also concerned that supply \\nchallenges could curtail their clients’ sales and soften \\ntheir demand for credit.   \\n\\nProfessional and Business Services \\nDemand for professional and business services re-\\nmained strong. Authentication services continued to \\nbenefit from the further expansion of ecommerce. Also, \\ndemand for consulting and technical services increased \\nas more companies began to recover from the pandem-\\nic. Overall, contacts anticipated that demand would \\ncontinue to grow as firms feel more comfortable moving \\nforward with projects that had previously been put on \\nhold. \\n\\nFreight \\nDemand for freight services remained robust, and vol-\\numes increased as the broader economy continued to \\nrecover. Contacts commented that shortages of shipping \\ncontainers and bottlenecks at ports continue to be prob-\\nlematic. Looking forward, contacts expected demand to \\nimprove further in coming months, although many antici-\\npate that a persistent driver shortage will constrain \\ngrowth. ■ \\n\\n \\n\\nFor more information about District economic conditions visit: \\nwww.clevelandfed.org/region \\n\\n\\n\\nE-1 \\n\\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond \\n\\nSummary of Economic Activity \\n\\nThe regional economy expanded moderately since our previous report. Manufacturers reported strong growth in ship-\\nments and new orders, intensifying already-sizeable backlogs and long lead times. Port and trucking volumes also rose \\n\\nas both import and export activity picked up. Retailers experienced moderate growth and increased foot traffic at physi-\\n\\ncal stores. New car sales were limited by low inventories, which spurred higher demand for used vehicles. Consumer \\ntravel and tourism rose, particularly for weekend destinations, while business travel remained low. Despite the easing of \\n\\nCOVID-related restrictions, some restaurants and hospitality services were unable to open to full capacity because they \\n\\nwere unable to hire more workers. Similarly, demand for nonfinancial services rose but growth was constrained by labor \\nshortages. The demand for residential real estate remained high amid very low inventory levels. Commercial real estate \\n\\nleasing increased moderately, including some office leasing as businesses returned to working in-person. Loan activity \\n\\nrose, particularly for business loans. Employment increased modestly, but many firms reported having difficulties filling \\nopen positions. Prices rose sharply in recent weeks as shortages of labor and materials led to higher costs, some of \\n\\nwhich translated to higher prices to customers.  \\n\\nEmployment and Wages  \\nEmployment rose modestly in recent weeks, but job \\n\\ngrowth was somewhat constrained by labor shortages as \\n\\nfirms across a variety of industries reported having diffi-\\nculty filling open positions. One contact speaking about \\n\\nthe hospitality sector thought that many former workers \\n\\nwere either choosing to remain unemployed or had found \\nnew jobs in another industry. Several contacts also noted \\n\\nincreased turnover and one reported that employees \\nwere leaving for advancement opportunities. Wages \\n\\nincreased moderately, overall. Strong demand for work-\\n\\ners, particularly at the entry-level, drove up starting wag-\\nes. Several employers also noted that raising wages for \\n\\nentry-level positions led them to raise wages to retain \\n\\nmore experienced staff.  \\n\\nPrices  \\nOverall, prices increased sharply in recent weeks. Price \\nincreases were largely attributed to strong demand, \\n\\nrising input costs, and supply constraints. Firms across \\n\\ngoods-producing and service-providing industries experi-\\nenced increased prices paid for labor, energy, shipping, \\n\\nraw materials, and inventories, but the degree to which \\n\\nthose price increases were passed on to customers \\nvaried. For example, a furniture store said that they were \\n\\nunable to pass along increased costs because of online \\n\\ncompetition and MSRP pricing. In contrast, a small appli-\\n\\nance manufacturer was able to pass along price increas-\\n\\nes because others in their industry faced similar rising \\n\\ninput costs and were also raising prices.   \\n\\nManufacturing \\nFifth District manufacturers saw strong growth in de-\\nmand in recent weeks, as both shipments and new or-\\n\\nders increased. Manufacturers of materials, home \\n\\ngoods, and food reported especially high demand. Lead \\ntimes lengthened, and inventories of inputs fell. Backlogs \\n\\nof orders grew, as shortages of labor and input goods \\n\\nconstrained production. Trucking and shipping container \\nshortages, as well as delays at ports, contributed to \\n\\ndifficulties in receiving inputs and in getting final goods to \\n\\ncustomers. Because of the delays in receiving and high \\ncosts of inputs, many manufacturers looked for substitu-\\n\\ntions for regular inputs and eliminated certain products.  \\n\\nPorts and Transportation \\nFifth District ports saw robust growth in recent weeks, as \\n\\nvolumes continued to break records. Growth of both \\nimports and exports was strong, with notable accelera-\\n\\ntion in the growth of exports. On the import side, vol-\\n\\numes were driven by retail goods, especially furniture, \\nhome goods, and home improvement goods. On the \\n\\nexport side, volumes of agricultural products were high. \\nBoth imports and exports of automobiles were volatile, \\n\\nThe Beige Book ■ May 2021 \\n\\n\\n\\nE-2 \\n\\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond   \\n\\nwhich contacts attributed to the microchip shortage.  \\n\\nFifth District trucking companies reported moderate \\ngrowth from already high volumes in recent weeks. \\n\\nDemand exceeded supply, as labor and equipment \\nconstraints caused truckers to turn business away. \\n\\nShipments of most goods rose, as volumes of home \\n\\nimprovement goods were especially strong, and some \\nsupplies for business conventions began to move. Sup-\\n\\nply shortages and long lead times for new tractors and \\n\\ntrailers led companies to rely more heavily on repairing \\nand reusing older equipment.  \\n\\nRetail, Travel, and Tourism \\nFifth District retailers reported moderate growth in de-\\n\\nmand and revenues in recent weeks. Shopper traffic \\n\\nincreased, and shoppers were generally serious about \\nmaking purchases. Clothing sales began to increase \\n\\nafter a soft year, and demand for home goods remained \\n\\nstrong. However, many retailers reported that supply \\nchain disruptions, such as shipping and production \\n\\ndelays, were limiting inventories. Auto inventories were \\n\\nespecially low and continued to shrink, as the microchip \\nshortage limited supply of new cars and increased de-\\n\\nmand for used vehicles, which were also in short supply. \\n\\nTravel and tourism increased moderately in the Fifth \\n\\nDistrict since our last report. Visitation was especially \\nstrong at beaches and other outdoor attractions. Some \\n\\nmuseums and restaurants opened amid strengthening \\n\\nbusiness conditions. Hotels saw short booking-windows \\nbut high occupancy on weekends, which contacts at-\\n\\ntributed to leisure travel, mostly from people who live in \\n\\ndrivable distance. Hotel occupancy was lower during the \\nweek, as group and business traveled remained soft, \\n\\nbut inquiries for group travel increased. Restaurants, \\nhotels, and other attractions reported cutting services \\n\\nand restricting capacity because of labor constraints.  \\n\\nReal Estate and Construction \\nDemand for homes held fairly steady at high levels since \\n\\nour last report. Prices continued to rise, and the average \\n\\ntime to sell a home shortened. Builders saw a continued \\ndrop in inventories, with some communities selling out of \\n\\nhomes. Agents noted that more resale homes were \\nbeing put on the market but were being absorbed too \\n\\nquickly to boost inventories. Construction and material \\n\\ncosts continued to increase, and shortages of materials \\ncaused building delays. Real estate agents noted that \\n\\nmortgage applications were getting approved, but they \\n\\nwere increasingly seeing cash sales. \\n\\nCommercial real estate leasing expanded moderately in \\nrecent weeks, but new projects were delayed by short-\\n\\nages and high costs of inputs. Multifamily occupancy \\n\\nand rental rates rose. Retail leasing strengthened, lead-\\n\\ning to falling vacancy rates as stores and restaurants \\n\\nopened and expanded, and contacts noted an increase \\nin new construction. Office leasing improved as busi-\\n\\nnesses returned to the workplace, and some agreed to \\n\\nlonger-term leases than in the past year and took ad-\\nvantage of leasing concessions. Industrial leasing re-\\n\\nmained strong despite increasing rates, and new con-\\n\\nstruction continued.  \\n\\nBanking and Finance \\nOverall loan demand rose moderately this period due in \\npart to the need for increased capital as businesses \\n\\ncontinuing to emerge from the pandemic. Financial insti-\\n\\ntutions indicated a moderate demand for conventional \\ncommercial lending driven by improving consumer and \\n\\nbusiness sentiment as well as sustained low rates. In \\n\\naddition, contacts noted a continued slight growth in \\nmortgage lending, but reported a slight decline in refi-\\n\\nnancing requests. Deposit growth was strong owing to \\nthe recent round of stimulus payments. This has led to \\n\\nincreased competition among financial institutions as \\n\\nfirms seek to deploy these deposits. Credit quality and \\ndelinquencies remained good.  \\n\\nNonfinancial Services \\nThe demand for nonfinancial services rose moderately in \\n\\nrecent weeks. An increase in health services demand \\n\\nwas driven by non-COVID-related services and elective \\nprocedures. A university president reported a substantial \\n\\nspike in applications, but noted that applications from \\n\\nlower income students were down slightly. Meanwhile, \\nan advertising agency reported solid growth in new ad \\n\\nspending, particularly from small businesses. There were \\n\\nseveral reports, however, that the inability to find addi-\\ntional workers was limiting sales and revenue growth. ■ \\n\\nFor more information about District economic conditions visit:  \\nwww.richmondfed.org/research/data_analysis \\n\\n\\n\\nF-1 \\n\\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta \\n\\nSummary of Economic Activity \\n\\nEconomic activity in the Sixth District expanded at a moderate pace, on net, from April through mid-May. Demand for \\n\\nlabor strengthened, though shortages among low-skilled workers persisted. Wage pressures increased for positions in \\nhigh demand. Some nonlabor costs continued to rise, and pricing power remained mixed. Retail sales activity increased, \\n\\nand auto sales rose more than expected. Hotel occupancy levels rose due to robust leisure travel activity; however, \\n\\nhotels dependent on business travel continued to struggle. Demand for housing remained strong and home prices con-\\ntinued to rise. Conditions in commercial real estate were mixed. Manufacturing activity strengthened as new orders and \\n\\nproduction levels rose. Conditions at financial institutions were stable, and consumer loan demand grew slightly. \\n\\nEmployment and Wages  \\nOverall employment in the District increased since the \\n\\nprevious report. Contacts reported strengthening de-\\n\\nmand for labor as economies in the region began to \\nreopen. Demand was strongest among lower-skilled \\n\\npositions, and employers reported that labor availability \\n\\namong that segment was very low. Shortages were also \\nnoted among skilled trade workers, nurses, IT workers \\n\\nand commercial drivers. Many employers continued to \\nstate that expanded unemployment insurance benefits \\n\\nand stimulus payments were keeping would-be workers \\n\\non the sidelines; others indicated that childcare, trans-\\nportation issues, and the inability to guarantee hours \\n\\nwere key factors in preventing potential workers f rom \\n\\nseeking employment. Employers indicated there was a \\ngreat deal of churn among low-skill, low-wage positions, \\n\\nand many reported that labor shortages had a limiting \\n\\neffect on services to customers, as well as the produc-\\ntion of goods, which is contributing to supply chain dis-\\n\\nruptions. Several contacts anticipate that labor shortages \\n\\nwill abate this fall but there is a great deal of uncertainty \\naround how much supply will materialize. For firms with \\n\\nlimited supply of labor in their markets, opportunities to \\n\\noffer remote work for some positions have removed \\ngeographic barriers, allowing employers broader access \\n\\nto talent. \\n\\nWage pressure picked up f rom April through mid-May, \\n\\nand upward pressure was most notable among low-\\nskilled positions. Within this segment, reports of wage \\n\\nincreases were more widespread with referral and sign-\\n\\ning bonuses becoming increasingly more common. \\nAmong the more skilled positions, wage increases were \\n\\nmore modest.   \\n\\nPrices  \\nDistrict contacts reported that input costs, particularly for \\n\\nlumber, steel, transportation, and shipping remained at \\n\\nelevated levels. Increased costs in construction materials \\nand labor slowed business expansion projects. Reports \\n\\non pricing power were mixed, but many contacts cit-\\n\\ned the removal of promotional pricing to maintain mar-\\ngins. The Atlanta Fed ’s Business Inflation Expectations \\n\\nsurvey showed year-over-year unit costs increased \\nsignificantly to 2.8 percent on average in May. Year-\\n\\nahead expectations increased to 2.8 percent in May, up \\n\\nf rom 2.5 percent in April.  \\n\\nConsumer Spending and Tourism \\nDistrict retailers continued to report healthy sales activity \\n\\nover the reporting period, driven largely by tourism. \\nAlthough auto production and inventory levels fell due to \\n\\ntight chip supplies, sales rose well above forecasted \\nlevels for April.  \\n\\nTravel and tourism contacts across the District reported \\ncontinued strong demand in leisure travel, with hotel \\n\\noccupancy levels in the 80-90 percent range. Contacts \\n\\nnoted an uptick in bookings for business travel, conven-\\ntions and special events planned for the second half of \\n\\nthe year. International travel activity continued to be \\nconstrained as vaccine distribution in other countries \\n\\nremained slow.  \\n\\nConstruction and Real Estate \\nHousing activity throughout the District remained strong \\n\\nover the reporting period. Relatively low interest rates \\nand a shift f rom renting towards home buying remained \\n\\nprimary drivers of demand, as well as an increase in \\n\\nbuyers moving to the region from higher cost

\\n\\nhttps://www.atlantafed.org/economy-matters/regional-economics/\\n\\n\\nG-1 \\n\\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago \\n\\nSummary of Economic Activity \\n\\nEconomic activity in the Seventh District increased moderately in April and early May and approached its pre-pandemic \\n\\nlevel. Contacts expected strong growth in the coming months. Employment, consumer spending, business spending, \\n\\nand manufacturing production all increased moderately, while construction and real estate was flat. Wages and prices \\n\\nrose moderately and financial conditions improved slightly. Prospects for agriculture income in 2021 improved. \\n\\nEmployment and Wages  \\nEmployment increased moderately over the reporting \\n\\nperiod, and contacts expected a strong increase over the \\n\\nnext 12 months. Contacts again reported minimal em-\\n\\nployee absenteeism due to Covid-19 infections or expo-\\n\\nsures. Help wanted signs sprouted across the District as \\n\\nbusinesses sought to meet growing demand. Contacts \\n\\nacross sectors reported greater difficulty in finding work-\\n\\ners, particularly at the entry level. Employers, temp \\n\\nagencies, and workforce development organizations \\n\\npointed to a number of factors limiting labor supply, \\n\\nincluding health safety concerns, childcare challenges, \\n\\ncutbacks in public transportation schedules, job search \\n\\nfatigue, and financial support from the government. \\n\\nOverall, wage and benefit costs increased moderately. \\n\\nHowever, contacts across sectors noted strong pressure \\n\\nto raise wages, particularly at the entry level, and there \\n\\nwere widespread reports of businesses offering signing \\n\\nbonuses. In addition, there was an increase in reports of \\n\\nfirms hiring employees away from other firms by offering \\n\\ngreater pay. \\n\\nPrices \\nOverall, prices rose moderately in April and early May, \\n\\nand contacts expected similar-sized increases over the \\n\\nnext 12 months. Contacts noted that prices for copper, \\n\\nsteel, aluminum, metal products, resins, natural gas, \\n\\nfood products, PVC pipes, and lumber were noticeably \\n\\nhigher. Business output prices moved up moderately, \\n\\ndriven by passthrough of higher material, energy, and \\n\\ntransportation costs. Many manufacturers said that un-\\n\\nlike usual, they were able to raise prices with little \\n\\npushback. Consumer prices moved up moderately due \\n\\nlargely to increased costs; in response there were re-\\n\\nports of some retailers limiting operating hours or trying \\n\\nto cut costs by renegotiating leases. \\n\\nConsumer Spending \\nConsumer spending increased moderately over the \\n\\nreporting period. Contacts said that looser pandemic-\\n\\nrelated restrictions and stimulus payments from the \\n\\nAmerican Rescue Plan supported activity, though the \\n\\nimpact of the payments had waned in recent weeks. \\n\\nSpending on leisure and hospitality services rose but \\n\\nstayed below pre-pandemic levels. Nonauto retail sales \\n\\nincreased moderately, with continuing high levels of \\n\\ndemand for furniture, home furnishings, home improve-\\n\\nments, electronics, appliances, and sporting goods. \\n\\nGrocery store sales remained healthy and there were \\n\\nagain reports of consumers trading up for more expen-\\n\\nsive items, such as premium meat cuts, finer wines, and \\n\\nseafood. Contacts from some large open-air shopping \\n\\ncenters reported that consumer traffic levels had recov-\\n\\nered to or remained just below 2019 levels. New and \\n\\nThe Beige Book ■ May 2021 \\n\\n\\n\\nG-2 \\n\\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago   \\n\\nused light vehicle sales increased modestly from a high \\n\\nlevel, but with sales constrained by issues of vehicle \\n\\navailability. \\n\\nBusiness Spending \\nBusiness spending increased moderately in April and \\n\\nearly May. Retail inventories were uncomfortably low for \\n\\nmany items, and contacts expected challenges to contin-\\n\\nue through much of 2021. New and used light vehicle \\n\\ninventory levels fell further—to very low levels for new \\n\\nvehicles. One dealer reported that their stocks were at \\n\\n33% of normal and that the manufacturer indicated the \\n\\nsituation wouldn’t improve until August at the earliest. \\n\\nMany manufacturing contacts said inventories were \\n\\nbelow comfortable levels. Contacts noted that supply \\n\\nchain issues had worsened, particularly for raw materi-\\n\\nals, microchips, and specialty parts. They expected little \\n\\nimprovement through the end of the year. Demand for \\n\\ntransportation services increased moderately. Many \\n\\ncontacts reported ongoing shipping delays, both from \\n\\noverseas and within the U.S. Capital expenditures were \\n\\nup moderately, and contacts expected a moderate in-\\n\\ncrease over the next twelve months. Several contacts \\n\\nsaid that long wait times for equipment were holding \\n\\nback spending. Demand for commercial and industrial \\n\\nenergy consumption was little changed overall. \\n\\nConstruction and Real Estate \\nConstruction and real estate activity increased slightly \\n\\nover the reporting period. Residential construction was \\n\\nlittle changed from a strong level. Contacts said that \\n\\nrising costs due to limited lot availability and higher ma-\\n\\nterial costs (particularly for lumber) were putting a damp-\\n\\ner on building. Home remodeling activity was strong and \\n\\ncontinued to grow. Residential real estate activity in-\\n\\ncreased moderately despite low inventory levels. Strong \\n\\ndemand pushed home prices up noticeably, with many \\n\\nselling for well above list price. Residential rents edged \\n\\nup. Nonresidential construction increased slightly, with \\n\\ncontacts highlighting growth in the industrial and trans-\\n\\nportation infrastructure sectors. Commercial real estate \\n\\nactivity was little changed overall. Rising demand for \\n\\nindustrial space was offset by falling demand for office \\n\\nand retail space. That said, a few contacts noted that \\n\\nretail space that had emptied earlier in the pandemic \\n\\nwas starting to fill again. Commercial real estate prices \\n\\nincreased marginally and rents were unchanged. The \\n\\navailability of sublease space was up modestly as some \\n\\noffices trimmed their post-pandemic footprint. \\n\\nManufacturing \\nManufacturing production increased moderately in April \\n\\nand early May despite widely reported supply chain \\n\\nchallenges. Most manufacturing contacts said that busi-\\n\\nness was above pre-pandemic levels. Auto output de-\\n\\nclined slightly due to parts shortages, notably of micro-\\n\\nchips. Steel production increased moderately to meet \\n\\ngrowing demand from manufacturers, builders, and the \\n\\nenergy sector. Demand for heavy machinery also grew \\n\\nmoderately, spurred by growth for construction, mining, \\n\\nand agriculture. Specialty metals manufacturers reported \\n\\na solid increase in shipments, but also a large increase \\n\\nin backlogs as they struggled to keep up with demand. \\n\\nBanking and Finance \\nFinancial conditions improved slightly over the reporting \\n\\nperiod. Participants in the equity and bond markets \\n\\nreported a small improvement in conditions, though \\n\\nvolatility remained elevated. Lenders continued to report \\n\\nthat businesses and households had large amounts of \\n\\ncash on hand to finance spending. Business loan vol-\\n\\numes were little changed on balance, with contacts \\n\\nhighlighting strength in construction and manufacturing, \\n\\nbut weakness in commercial real estate and leisure and \\n\\nhospitality. Business loan quality increased slightly \\n\\nacross most segments. Contacts reported stiff competi-\\n\\ntion for loan opportunities and that standards had loos-\\n\\nened a bit. In consumer markets, loan demand increased \\n\\nmodestly, led by ongoing growth in residential mortgage \\n\\nactivity. Consumer loan quality increased slightly, while \\n\\ncredit standards were little changed. \\n\\nAgriculture \\nExpectations for farm income in 2021 strengthened \\n\\nacross sectors in April and early May. Drought and dry \\n\\nweather conditions were an issue across a substantial \\n\\nportion of the District, though timely rains could still \\n\\nerase most of the impact. Frosts damaged some plants \\n\\nand trees, with potentially heavy losses for fruit produc-\\n\\ners. Corn and soybean planting proceeded ahead of the \\n\\nnormal pace. Corn, soybean, and wheat prices moved \\n\\nup and were near multi-year highs. Hog, cattle, and milk \\n\\nprices rose, helped by strong meat and dairy exports. \\n\\nEgg prices dropped however. Despite higher prices, \\n\\nlivestock producers’ margins were little improved be-\\n\\ncause of higher feed costs. Farmland values increased \\n\\nonce again, because of strong demand and limited in-\\n\\nventory. ■ \\n\\nFor more information about District economic conditions visit:  \\nchicagofed.org/cfsbc

\\n\\n\\n\\nI-1 \\n\\nFederal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis \\n\\nSummary of Economic Activity \\n\\nNinth District economic activity grew at a moderate-to-strong pace since early April. Employment grew moderately, with \\n\\nstrong hiring demand outpacing labor availability. Wage pressures were moderate overall, and wholesale price pres-\\n\\nsures increased briskly while consumer prices increased more moderately. Growth was noted in consumer spending, \\n\\nconstruction, real estate, manufacturing, agriculture, and energy. Minority- and women-owned businesses in the region \\n\\nreported moderate improvements in business activity.  \\n\\nEmployment and Wages \\n Employment grew moderately since the last report, with \\n\\nstrong hiring demand outpacing labor availability. Job \\n\\npostings saw strong increases in recent weeks, \\n\\nparticularly in South Dakota and Montana. A Minnesota \\n\\nstaffing firm with multiple offices said every location had \\n\\nat least 100 job openings. Hiring demand was healthy \\n\\nacross all sectors, but was strongest in manufacturing, \\n\\nconstruction, health care, and hospitality. Recent hiring \\n\\nand near-term hiring expectations improved for firms of \\n\\nall sizes; however, large firms reported significantly \\n\\nstronger hiring tendencies. For those hiring, most said \\n\\ntheir ability to find and hire staff was moderately or \\n\\nextremely difficult. Contacts in the Dakotas and Montana \\n\\nexpected some improvement in labor availability with the \\n\\nearly elimination of enhanced federal unemployment \\n\\nbenefits in those states. But the action itself was weeks \\n\\naway, and competition for new entrants would be high. \\n\\nWage pressures were moderate overall. Wage growth \\n\\namong the large majority of contacts remained below 3 \\n\\npercent on an annualized basis. Workers at construction, \\n\\nmanufacturing, and hospitality firms saw stronger wage \\n\\ngrowth, while many service-related firms saw weaker \\n\\ngrowth. Future wage expectations were slightly higher, \\n\\nbut not well aligned with firms’ broader concerns over \\n\\nlabor availability. A manufacturer of construction \\n\\nproducts recently increased hourly wages by $3 an hour \\n\\nand saw job applications jump significantly. \\n\\nWorker Experience \\nJob seekers saw modest improvement in labor market \\n\\nconditions since the last report. While hiring demand was \\n\\nrobust, job service contacts reported low wages as a \\n\\nmoderate or significant barrier keeping job seekers from \\n\\ntaking available jobs. They also noted increased interest \\n\\nin telework, but few viable options. A workforce contact \\n\\nsaid that displaced high-income earners were actively \\n\\nseeking jobs to replace lost income, while low-income \\n\\nearners were more likely to stay on the sidelines if they \\n\\nwere receiving government benefits. Contacts also cited \\n\\nthe challenges of childcare and children’s school \\n\\nschedules in making employment decisions. Several \\n\\ncontacts pointed to increased inoculations and the \\n\\ngradual return of activities in travel and hospitality as \\n\\npositives for frontline workers. A labor contact expressed \\n\\nthat while employment for janitorial workers remains 10 \\n\\npercent below pre-pandemic levels, more janitors were \\n\\nfinding work deep cleaning commercial spaces.  \\n\\nPrices  \\nWholesale price pressures increased briskly, while \\n\\nconsumer prices increased more moderately, as ongoing \\n\\nspikes in certain inputs fed through to final prices. Nearly \\n\\na quarter of respondents to a business conditions survey \\n\\nreported nonlabor input price increases of greater than \\n\\n10 percent relative to pre-pandemic levels. Pressures \\n\\nwere slightly lower for final/retail prices charged to \\n\\ncustomers. Respondents to a construction survey noted \\n\\nincreases in materials costs across the board, but \\n\\nThe Beige Book ■ May 2021 \\n\\n\\n\\nI-2 \\n\\nFederal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis   \\n\\nparticularly sharp increases for lumber, steel, and copper \\n\\nwire. Manufacturing contacts continued to report higher \\n\\nfinal prices due to increased costs for raw materials, \\n\\npackaging, and transportation. However, contacts \\n\\noffered that growing demand was allowing firms to pass \\n\\nalong a greater share of markups to customers. Retail \\n\\nfuel prices increased at a moderately strong pace since \\n\\nthe previous report. \\n\\nConsumer Spending \\nConsumer spending was slightly higher since the last \\n\\nreport, but remained at elevated levels. Restaurants, \\n\\nbars, hotels, and recreation firms all reported increased \\n\\nactivity in recent weeks. However, many reported \\n\\ndifficulty hiring and were operating at limited hours and/\\n\\nor capacity. A Montana contact said tourism firms were \\n\\n“facing the toughest recruiting season ever.” Auto sales \\n\\nin the western portion of the District remained strong, \\n\\nwith low inventories remaining the biggest obstacle. \\n\\n“Most new units are spoken for by the time they arrive at \\n\\nthe dealerships,” said one Montana contact. Similar \\n\\ndemand was reported for recreational and marine \\n\\nvehicles. Airline passenger levels have hit a seasonal lull \\n\\nbefore the summer travel season, but a North Dakota \\n\\ntravel contact said activity was expected to rise “once \\n\\nfamilies begin summer vacations.” A regional shopping \\n\\ncenter in Minnesota said that traffic had been rising; \\n\\nwhile still below pre-pandemic levels, growth was \\n\\nexpected to continue due to pent-up demand.  \\n\\nConstruction and Real Estate \\nCommercial construction activity grew slightly overall, \\n\\nheld back by supply chain disruptions and rising costs for \\n\\nmaterials. Overall project activity showed signs of \\n\\nincreasing, according to two industry trackers and \\n\\ncontacts across the District. However, many contacts \\n\\nalso noted that supply chain problems and inflated \\n\\nmaterials costs were creating significant project delays \\n\\nand some outright cancellations, and lack of available \\n\\nlabor was further eroding their ability to either take on \\n\\nwork or complete projects. All of these pressures were \\n\\nhaving a noticeable effect on profits. Similar difficulties \\n\\nwere evident in residential construction. However, \\n\\ncontacts noted stronger overall demand and outlooks, \\n\\nand recent residential permitting remained robust across \\n\\nmany of the District’s larger markets. \\n\\nCommercial real estate improved modestly overall, \\n\\nthough subsectors varied. Industrial property remained \\n\\nstrong, with some speculative building reentering the \\n\\nmarket. Vacancy rates rose in office and retail, with \\n\\nsublease activity also increasing. Apartment vacancy \\n\\nrates remained low across the District, and rents were \\n\\nreportedly rising again, but uncertainty related to the \\n\\nelimination of eviction moratoriums remained. \\n\\nResidential real estate continued to see strong home \\n\\nsales across the District. In many District markets, \\n\\ninventories of homes for sale were half—or less—of last \\n\\nyear’s levels; shortages were acute among lower-priced \\n\\nhomes, sparking offers above asking prices. \\n\\nManufacturing \\nDistrict manufacturing activity increased briskly since the \\n\\nlast report despite sharp cost increases. An April index of \\n\\nregional manufacturing conditions indicated strong \\n\\nexpansion in activity in Minnesota and increased activity \\n\\nin North Dakota and South Dakota from a month earlier. \\n\\nMore than half of manufacturing contacts reported that \\n\\nthey expect revenues to increase in the second quarter \\n\\nof 2021 from the previous quarter.   \\n\\nAgriculture, Energy, and Natural Resources \\nAgricultural conditions improved sharply since the \\n\\nprevious report. Contacts expected strong farm incomes \\n\\nheading into planting season, building on recent \\n\\ncommodity price increases and export demand. Crop \\n\\nprogress as of mid-May was generally well ahead of \\n\\nrecent averages in District states. However, extreme \\n\\ndrought conditions spread in portions of the District. \\n\\nDistrict oil and gas exploration activity increased slightly \\n\\nsince the previous report, but remained well below its pre\\n\\n-pandemic level.  \\n\\nMinority- and Women-Owned Business Enterprises  \\nMinority- and women-owned business enterprises \\n\\n(MWBEs) in the region reported moderate improvements \\n\\nin business activity, according to a May survey. \\n\\nCustomer traffic and revenue is modestly to significantly \\n\\nhigher compared with the same period a year ago, when \\n\\nrestrictions were imposed. A contact working with \\n\\nminority entrepreneurs warned that barriers faced by \\n\\nmany businesses to access financial assistance during \\n\\nthe pandemic continued to put them behind in the \\n\\nrecovery. They further indicated that while many \\n\\nbusinesses have been technologically adapting to the \\n\\nnew environment, some clients lack the knowledge and/\\n\\nor capacity to do so. A contact in the hospitality industry \\n\\nexpressed difficulty finding employees and highlighted \\n\\nthe inability of small businesses to match current income \\n\\nfrom government benefits. Like firms overall, MWBE \\n\\nmanufacturing and construction businesses were faring \\n\\nwell, but also faced labor and material shortages, \\n\\nrespectively. ■ \\n\\nFor more information on the Ninth District economy, visit: \\n\\nminneapolisfed.org/region-and-community  \\n\\n  \\n\\nhttps://www.minneapolisfed.org/region-and-community\\n\\n\\nJ-1 \\n\\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \\n\\nSummary of Economic Activity \\n\\nConditions in the Tenth District economy continued to improve at a moderate pace in April and May, and contacts in most \\n\\nsectors anticipated additional gains in the months ahead. Consumer spending increased moderately as retail, restaurant, \\n\\nand tourism sales rose. Sales exceeded pre-pandemic levels for the majority of retail, restaurant, and auto contacts, while \\n\\ntourism and healthcare sales remained below pre-pandemic levels. Manufacturing activity expanded robustly, and almost \\n\\ntwo-thirds of manufacturers reported that new orders were at or above pre-pandemic levels. Contacts also reported sales \\n\\ngains in the wholesale trade, professional and high-tech, and transportation sectors. Residential real estate activity in-\\n\\ncreased and home prices rose robustly as inventories fell further from already low levels. Commercial real estate activity \\n\\nincreased slightly for the first time since the pandemic started. The energy sector expanded as production, commodity \\n\\nprices, and capital expenditures moved higher. The farm economy remained strong, but drought conditions continued to \\n\\nstrain producers in the western part of the region. Employment rose at a modest pace, and wages increased moderately. \\n\\nInput prices increased robustly, while selling prices increased at a moderate pace.            \\n\\n \\n\\nEmployment and Wages  \\nDistrict employment continued to increase modestly \\n\\nduring the survey period in both the services and manu-\\n\\nfacturing sectors, with a slight majority of contacts in \\n\\nboth industries indicating that employment levels were \\n\\nnow at or above pre-pandemic levels. Recent employ-\\n\\nment gains in the services sector were driven by hiring in \\n\\nthe retail and wholesale trade industries, while transpor-\\n\\ntation, auto, and real estate contacts reported slight \\n\\ndeclines. Looking ahead, services contacts expected \\n\\nmodest increases in employment in the coming months, \\n\\nwith slightly stronger gains in tourism and wholesale \\n\\ntrade. Manufacturers anticipated both employment levels \\n\\nand hours to rise moderately in the next few months.  \\nThe majority of contacts reported labor shortages, with \\n\\nmany contacts noting demand for all positions and sev-\\n\\neral others in need of truck drivers and technicians. More \\n\\nthan three-quarters of contacts reported that the inability \\n\\nto find workers with the required skills was restraining \\n\\nhiring plans. Wages rose moderately, and while the \\n\\nmajority of contacts expected wage growth to remain \\n\\nmoderate throughout 2021, more than one-third of man-\\n\\nufacturing and services contacts expected to raise wag-\\n\\nes by 4 percent or more at their firms.                 \\n\\nPrices  \\nThe prices of raw materials rose robustly in both the \\n\\nmanufacturing and services sectors since the previous \\n\\nsurvey, while selling prices increased at a slightly more \\n\\nmoderate pace. The majority of respondents also indicat-\\n\\ned that selling prices were above pre-pandemic levels. \\n\\nMore than one-third of contacts reported that rising ma-\\n\\nterials prices and supply issues, such as lack of availabil-\\n\\nity or increased delivery times, were having a strong \\n\\nnegative effect on their firm, and an additional one-third \\n\\nof contacts reported a slight negative impact from these \\n\\nfactors. About 80 percent of contacts expected these \\n\\nfactors to persist for 12 months or less. Contacts in both \\n\\nsectors expected input prices to continue to rise robustly \\n\\nover the next six months, while the growth rate of selling \\n\\nprices was anticipated to accelerate.                \\n\\nConsumer Spending \\nConsumer spending grew moderately over the survey \\n\\nperiod, and the majority of contacts noted that sales \\n\\nwere above pre-pandemic levels. The strongest sales \\n\\ngains in April and May were observed in the retail, res-\\n\\ntaurant, and tourism sectors. Compared to pre-pandemic \\n\\nlevels, more than 70 percent of retailers and half of \\n\\nrestaurant owners indicated higher sales, while the ma-\\n\\njority of tourism contacts continued to report lower sales. \\n\\nHealth services and auto sales held fairly steady since \\n\\nthe previous survey, with health services sales still below \\n\\npre-pandemic levels and auto sales above. Respondents \\n\\nacross all consumer sectors expected sales gains in the \\n\\nThe Beige Book ■ May 2021 \\n\\n\\n\\nJ-2 \\n\\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City   \\n\\ncoming months, with restaurant and tourism contacts \\n\\nexpecting particularly strong gains.           \\n\\nManufacturing and Other Business Activity  \\nManufacturing activity expanded robustly since the last \\n\\nsurvey as production and new orders increased at both \\n\\ndurable and nondurable goods plants, albeit with strong-\\n\\ner gains among durable goods producers.  Almost two-\\n\\nthirds of respondents indicated that new orders were \\n\\neither at or above pre-pandemic levels. Looking ahead, \\n\\nboth durable and nondurable goods manufacturers ex-\\n\\npected moderate gains in production, new orders, and \\n\\ncapital expenditures in the coming months.  \\n\\nOutside of manufacturing, sales rose robustly at whole-\\n\\nsale trade firms, moderately at transportation firms, and \\n\\nmodestly at professional and high-tech services firms in \\n\\nMay. In addition, capital expenditures increased modest-\\n\\nly over the survey period in all three sectors. Transporta-\\n\\ntion and wholesale trade contacts expected moderate-to-\\n\\nstrong sales gains over the next six months, while sales \\n\\nat professional and high-tech services firm were ex-\\n\\npected to continue to rise moderately.    \\n\\nReal Estate and Construction  \\n\\nResidential real estate activity continued to expand \\n\\nmoderately in April and May, while commercial real \\n\\nestate activity increased slightly for the first time since \\n\\nthe pandemic started. Home prices sustained robust \\n\\ngrowth as sales increased moderately and inventories \\n\\ncontinued to decline. Contacts expected these trends to \\n\\ncontinue in the coming months. Construction supply \\n\\nsales rose modestly since the last survey, and similar \\n\\ngains were expected in the next few months. Commer-\\n\\ncial real estate contacts noted modest increases in ab-\\n\\nsorption rates, sales, prices, rents, and construction as \\n\\nwell as a slight decrease in vacancy rates. Growth in \\n\\ncommercial sales and construction was expected to pick \\n\\nup in the coming months, and vacancy rates were ex-\\n\\npected to fall modestly. However, developers’ access to \\n\\ncredit was expected to become modestly more difficult.    \\n\\nBanking \\n\\nLoan demand rose slightly since the previous survey, \\n\\nwith gains driven by modest growth in the demand for \\n\\nconsumer installment loans and slight growth in the \\n\\ndemand for commercial real estate loans. Commercial, \\n\\nindustrial, and residential real estate loan demand held \\n\\nsteady, while demand for agricultural loans declined \\n\\nmodestly. Credit standards remained stable across all \\n\\nlending categories, and bankers reported that overall \\n\\nloan quality had improved strongly since last year. Addi-\\n\\ntional improvement in loan quality was anticipated over \\n\\nthe next six months. Deposit levels increased robustly in \\n\\nrecent weeks, with anecdotal evidence suggesting the \\n\\nincrease is concentrated in liquid accounts, such as \\n\\ndemand deposit accounts and savings accounts.                \\n\\nEnergy \\n\\nDistrict energy activity expanded in April and May as the \\n\\nnumber of active oil and natural gas rigs rose due to the \\n\\naddition of several oil rigs in Oklahoma. With a larger \\n\\nnumber of active rigs compared with a year ago, produc-\\n\\ntion levels also increased modestly. Multiple firms indi-\\n\\ncated capital spending plans aimed at increasing produc-\\n\\ntion in 2021 while reducing costs after restructuring over \\n\\nthe past year. Employment in the energy sector inched \\n\\nup slightly across the District since the last survey peri-\\n\\nod, but the number of jobs remained considerably below \\n\\nyear-ago levels. A slight increase in commodity prices \\n\\nsince the last survey period supported higher revenues \\n\\nand profits for regional firms. Contacts across the District \\n\\nexpected stable to slightly higher oil prices for the re-\\n\\nmainder of the year as impacts from the pandemic con-\\n\\ntinue to wane and demand recovers.                 \\n\\nAgriculture \\n\\nThe Tenth District farm economy remained strong, but \\n\\ndrought continued to strain all types of producers in the \\n\\nwestern part of the region. Prices for corn, soybeans, \\n\\nwheat, cotton, and hogs increased in recent weeks and \\n\\nremained at multi-year highs through the early part of \\n\\nMay. In contrast, prospects for the cattle industry re-\\n\\nmained subdued as cattle prices were near pre-\\n\\npandemic levels but profit opportunities were limited due \\n\\nto elevated feed costs. Alongside severe drought in the \\n\\nwestern portion of the District, the wheat crop was in \\n\\npoorer condition in Colorado relative to other states. \\n\\nContacts also reported that the impact of drought on \\n\\npasture quality and hay production continued to worsen.  \\n\\n■ \\n\\nFor more information about District economic conditions visit: \\nwww.KansasCityFed.org/research/regional-research \\n\\n\\n\\nK-1 \\n\\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas \\n\\nSummary of Economic Activity \\nThe Eleventh District economy continued to expand at a solid pace during the reporting period. Growth in the manufac-\\nturing and nonfinancial services sectors was strong, though activity remained below pre-pandemic levels. Retail sales \\nwere mixed. Home sales and single-family construction remained robust, but activity was being constrained by labor, lot, \\nand materials shortages. Apartment demand rose, while office leasing stayed weak. Overall loan volume increased \\nsharply, buoyed by continued strength in real estate lending. Energy activity and agricultural conditions improved. Em-\\nployment growth was moderate, and upward wage pressures continued as hiring remained a key challenge for many \\ncompanies. Ongoing supply chain disruptions intensified price pressures, particularly in the construction and manufac-\\nturing sectors. Outlooks improved, though there was widespread apprehension about the sustainability of current de-\\nmand growth in light of supply constraints, difficulty hiring, and rising costs.  \\n\\nEmployment and Wages  \\nEmployment expanded at a moderate pace. Lack of \\nlabor availability, particularly for low-skilled positions, \\nwas a growing concern among firms trying to hire or \\nrecall workers, with a majority noting a lack of applicants \\nand generous unemployment benefits as impediments to \\nhiring. Many contacts, particularly accommodation and \\nfood service firms, reported sizable numbers of unfilled \\npositions, and some noted that existing staff have had to \\ntake on responsibilities outside of their normal jobs. \\nSome firms noted difficulties getting applicants to show \\nup for interviews, which further hampered hiring.   \\n\\nWages continued to increase, with reports of significant \\nupward pressure in industries having trouble finding and \\nretaining workers. There were multiple reports of consid-\\nerable wage pressures for mechanics, warehouse em-\\nployees, construction specialty trades, and truck drivers. \\nA manufacturer said that even with a starting hourly \\nwage of $14 for non-skilled workers, they were unable fill \\n20-plus open positions. \\n\\nPrices \\nPrice pressures intensified further in part due to persis-\\ntent supply chain issues, and multiple firms noted that \\nthis was affecting business growth. Input costs surged, \\nwith contacts in the construction, manufacturing, and \\nretail sectors citing the steepest increases. There were \\nseveral reports of higher prices of fuel, petrochemicals, \\nagricultural commodities, building materials, lumber, \\n\\nmetals, and vehicles, as well as rising freight costs. \\nSome contacts expect costs to remain elevated for some \\ntime due to strong demand and/or supply chain challeng-\\nes. Selling prices rose at a fast clip in many sectors. \\nHousing contacts noted difficulty obtaining appraisals \\ndue to rapid escalation in home prices. Compared to \\nyearend 2020, business contacts have revised upward \\ntheir expectations for input and selling price increases in \\n2021. \\n\\nManufacturing  \\nSolid expansion continued in the manufacturing sector, \\nthough the pace of growth eased from the prior reporting \\nperiod. Several durable goods manufacturers noted \\nlarge backorders and a lack of capacity to keep up with \\nstrong demand. Those noting slower activity said supply \\nchain issues combined with inventory or raw materials \\nshortages led to slowdowns in production schedules.  \\nRefining operations were recovering from the disruption \\ncaused by the Colonial pipeline outage, and contacts \\nwere increasingly optimistic for strong U.S. fuel demand \\nin the third quarter. Margins are expected to rise in the \\nsecond half of the year to near 2019 levels. Petrochemi-\\ncal production has mostly recovered from Winter Storm \\nUri outages, but supply chain disruptions were likely to \\npersist through yearend 2021. Overall outlooks im-\\nproved, although some manufacturers voiced concern \\nabout the dampening effect on activity of supply con-\\nstraints, extended lead times, and proposed tax hikes.  \\n\\nThe Beige Book ■ May 2021 \\n\\n\\n\\nK-2 \\n\\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas   \\n\\nRetail Sales \\nRetail sales grew robustly in April but dipped in May, \\nwhich contacts attributed to supply chain issues and low \\ninventories. Auto sales expanded as well during the \\nreporting period, though new car supplies were limited \\nby microchip shortages. Outlooks were positive, buoyed \\nby the reopening of the economy and current pace of \\nvaccinations, though rising costs and inventory shortag-\\nes remained a concern. \\n\\nNonfinancial Services \\nNonfinancial services expanded strongly over the report-\\ning period. Demand growth was broad based, led by \\nincreases in leisure and hospitality, transportation, and \\nprofessional and business services. Restaurateurs and \\nhoteliers said leisure activity was largely driving demand \\nas business travel remained sluggish. Airlines also cited \\nmodest increases in ticket sales, which they attributed to \\nimprovement in COVID statistics and easing restrictions. \\nLeisure travel continued to dominate airline bookings, \\nand contacts noted a pickup in reservations a few \\nmonths out. Staffing firms reported broad-based increas-\\nes in demand. In transportation services, air cargo vol-\\numes rose sharply due to continued strength in domestic \\ne-commerce activity. Container shipments coming \\nthrough the Port of Houston picked up, and small parcel \\nshipments increased as well. Outlooks were positive, \\nalthough there was apprehension regarding the sustain-\\nability of current demand growth along with proposed \\nchanges in tax policies among other regulations. \\n\\nConstruction and Real Estate \\nActivity in the single-family housing market remained \\nbrisk. Sales continued to be robust, though builders were \\nstruggling to keep up with demand and had to limit sales. \\nSeveral builders are shifting away from build-to-suit \\nconstruction to only starting inventory homes and selling \\nthem at the framing or drywall stage due to production \\nchallenges and escalating costs. In fact, in some instanc-\\nes, builders were selling lots and/or inventory homes to \\nthe highest bidder. Others who were still doing build-to-\\nsuit jobs noted including price escalation clauses in \\ncontracts to cover cost increases incurred during the \\nconstruction phase. Lot supply remained very tight as did \\nexisting and finished vacant home inventories. In the \\nexisting-home market, realtors reported bidding wars on \\nlistings and homes getting snapped up quickly. Outlooks \\nwere mixed, with contacts voicing concern about con-\\nstrained lot supply, appraisal issues, rising costs, and \\nlabor and material shortages. \\n\\nApartment demand was solid, pushing up occupancy \\nand rents. Apartment construction was ramping back up \\nafter a slowdown last year due to COVID. Contacts said \\n\\nthat there is a lot of money chasing multifamily deals and \\npricing on assets is quite aggressive. Industrial construc-\\ntion and leasing remained robust. Demand for office \\nspace remained weak and vacancies ticked up further.  \\n\\nFinancial Services \\nLoan volumes rose robustly over the past six weeks \\nsupported by continued strength in commercial and \\nresidential real estate activity. Commercial and industrial \\nloan volumes ticked up, while consumer lending was flat. \\nNonperforming loans declined, and credit standards \\nstayed somewhat tight. Loan pricing remained competi-\\ntive, and multiple contacts said they were flush with \\nliquidity and that it was difficult to deploy the excess \\ncapital to generate reasonable returns. Sentiment re-\\ngarding general business activity improved markedly, \\nwith 68 percent of respondents citing an increase over \\nthe past six weeks. Outlooks were optimistic, with con-\\ntacts expecting continued declines in non-performing \\nloans, strong loan demand, and increased general busi-\\nness activity six months from now. Nearly half of re-\\nspondents also noted that they expect long-term rates to \\nrise over the next 12 months.  \\n\\nEnergy \\nDrilling and completion activity rose further during the \\nreporting period. Oilfield services firms noted modest \\nhiring to support increased oil field activity. Exploration \\nand production firms expect the market to support a \\nWest Texas Intermediate price of $60-65, and reiterated \\nthat, at this price, capital spending plans would likely \\nremain unchanged among large U.S. producers. E&P \\nfirms have slightly revised up their production outlook for \\n2021 thanks to strong year-to-date results. Sentiment in \\nthe oil and gas industry improved further, though con-\\ntacts remained cautious about changes in tax policy and \\nrising fuel, materials, and labor costs.  \\n\\nAgriculture \\nRecent rainfall eased drought conditions in parts of the \\nDistrict and improved prospects for row crops. Agricultur-\\nal commodity prices moved higher across the board, \\nspurred by tight world supply and robust export demand. \\nOverall, row crop farmers were optimistic for improved \\nproduction and revenues this year. Significantly higher \\ngrain prices, however, have negatively affected the \\nlivestock sector with feed costs double what they were a \\nyear ago. Beef exports were strong, which together with \\ncontinued capacity constraints in meat packing plants \\nhave driven up beef prices to well-above-average levels. \\n■ \\n\\nFor more information about District economic conditions visit: \\nwww.dallasfed.org/research/texas \\n\\n\\n\\nL-1 \\n\\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco \\n\\nSummary of Economic Activity \\n\\nEconomic activity in the Twelfth District expanded significantly during the reporting period of April through mid-May. \\n\\nConditions in the agriculture and resources sectors improved notably, while manufacturing activity continued to expand \\n\\nat a modest rate. Contacts reported ongoing strength in residential real estate markets, but largely unchanged condi-\\n\\ntions in the commercial real estate sector. Lending activity rose somewhat, with increased competition for new loans \\n\\nand deals. Employment levels continued to increase modestly, accompanied by moderately higher wages. Price in-\\n\\ncreases stepped up considerably, driven by increased material costs and supply chain disruptions. Retail sales in-\\n\\ncreased a fair bit as vaccinations continued, allowing for further easing of social-distancing restrictions. Activity in the \\n\\nconsumer and business services sectors strengthened somewhat.  \\n\\n \\n\\nEmployment and Wages  \\nOverall employment levels continued to increase as the \\n\\nlabor market tightened in some regions. Employment \\n\\naccelerated in states that only recently lifted business \\n\\nrestrictions, like California, and slowed modestly in \\n\\nstates where unemployment levels were already low, as \\n\\nin the Mountain West. Most of the job growth was con-\\n\\ncentrated in the hospitality, retail, tourism, and food \\n\\nservices sectors, with employers seeking to rehire work-\\n\\ners as the economy reopens and demand for these \\n\\nservices strengthens. However, many of these employ-\\n\\ners also reported facing difficulties hiring and retaining \\n\\nworkers for low-skilled jobs, as did contacts in manufac-\\n\\nturing, construction, transportation, and agriculture. \\n\\nLabor demand also picked up in the technology and \\n\\nentertainment sectors while holding steady in the finan-\\n\\ncial and other professional services sectors.   \\n\\nWage pressures increased moderately. Employers in the \\n\\nconstruction, manufacturing, technology, retail, health-\\n\\ncare, restaurant, and hospitality sectors reported having \\n\\nto increase wages to retain and attract workers for both \\n\\nhigh- and low-skilled jobs. In addition to raising wages, \\n\\nthese employers also mentioned offering other incen-\\n\\ntives such as sign-on bonuses, reduced or flexible hours, \\n\\nand the ability to work remotely. Wage increases were \\n\\nespecially high in restaurants and hospitality services \\n\\nramping up to reopen, and employers reported difficul-\\n\\nties in rehiring workers. Wages in financial services \\n\\nremained stable.   \\n\\nPrices  \\nPrice increases stepped up considerably over the report-\\n\\ning period. Continuing supply chain disruptions, low \\n\\ninventories, and increasing labor costs have contributed \\n\\nto upward pricing pressures in recent weeks. These \\n\\nwere most pronounced for users of raw materials, espe-\\n\\ncially fuel and lumber. With burgeoning demand for food \\n\\nservices, prices for many agricultural products have also \\n\\nrisen, which translated into higher prices at grocers and \\n\\nsome restaurants. Additionally, prices for airline tickets, \\n\\nrental cars, and lodging have started to normalize from \\n\\nprevious lows.  \\n\\nRetail Trade and Services \\nRetail sales increased a fair bit over the reporting period. \\n\\nSales growth was particularly strong in restaurants and \\n\\ndrinking establishments during recent weeks, as the \\n\\ncontinued pace of vaccinations allowed for further easing \\n\\nof social-distancing restrictions. A number of contacts \\n\\nreported increased foot traffic in retail stores, while e-\\n\\ncommerce sales continued to be strong. However, retail-\\n\\ners across the District highlighted several supply chain \\n\\ndisruptions, including port issues, container shortages, \\n\\nand manufacturing delays. As a result, most retailers, \\n\\neven consignment and thrift stores, reported low invento-\\n\\nry stock and raised concerns that the current sales pace \\n\\nmight slow in coming months. Sales of new and used \\n\\nmotor vehicles remained robust, although constrained by \\n\\nlow inventories, as did those of home improvement \\n\\ngoods. Demand for airline reservations was noted to \\n\\nThe Beige Book ■ May 2021 \\n\\n\\n\\nL-2 \\n\\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco   \\n\\nhave picked up for the first time since the onset of the \\n\\npandemic.  \\n\\nActivity in the services sector also strengthened moder-\\n\\nately. Following the further unwinding of pandemic-\\n\\nrelated restrictions, conditions in the travel, leisure, en-\\n\\ntertainment, and hospitality industries improved, albeit \\n\\nslowly. Bookings for hotel rooms slightly increased due \\n\\nto a pickup in leisure travel. Restaurants reported operat-\\n\\ning at almost full capacity outdoors, although indoor \\n\\ndining capacity was still limited. Demand increased for \\n\\nautomotive parts and services, as well as for car rentals. \\n\\nIn health care, elective services and non-COVID-19 lab \\n\\ntesting increased modestly, but preventive services \\n\\nremained subdued. Demand for transportation and logis-\\n\\ntical services continued to be strong, while that of legal \\n\\nand other professional services was largely unchanged.  \\n\\nManufacturing \\nManufacturing activity continued to expand at a modest \\n\\nrate. New orders growth remained strong, especially for \\n\\nwood products, chemicals, manufactured metals, com-\\n\\nputers, electronics, and manufactured food products. Yet \\n\\ndelivery delays and shortages of input materials, such as \\n\\nsemiconductors, continued to hold back production and \\n\\ndecreased inventories in some cases. Wood product \\n\\nmanufacturers in the Pacific Northwest, already operat-\\n\\ning at full capacity, reported having to delay production \\n\\nof some orders. A contact in Southern California noted \\n\\nthat capacity utilization rates in manufacturing of renewa-\\n\\nble energy equipment have normalized, and new orders \\n\\nare generally growing.  \\n\\nAgriculture and Resource-Related Industries  \\nConditions in the agriculture and resources sectors \\n\\nnotably improved. Loosened capacity restrictions in \\n\\nrestaurants and drinking establishments contributed to \\n\\nstronger demand for agriculture products, including \\n\\nwheat, corn, nuts, and fruits. Demand from abroad also \\n\\nincreased, aided by the depreciating dollar in the later \\n\\npart of the reporting period. As a result, inventories of \\n\\nfruits and nuts were noted to have decreased to lower-\\n\\nthan-usual levels. However, supply chain disruptions \\n\\ncontinued to negatively affect many producers with one \\n\\nreporting both domestic and international logistical is-\\n\\nsues that resulted in significant delays in seafood prod-\\n\\nuct sales. Growers in California noted that current \\n\\ndrought conditions are expected to negatively impact \\n\\nannual crops this year, driving up labor and electricity \\n\\ncosts as farmers depend more on wells and water \\n\\npumps for irrigation.  \\n\\nReal Estate and Construction \\nResidential construction activity continued to expand at a \\n\\nbrisk pace. Demand for single-family homes remained \\n\\nstrong, although construction still failed to meet high \\n\\ndemand since the previous reporting period. The lack of \\n\\navailable homes was further exacerbated by increasing \\n\\nlabor and transportation costs, as well as widespread \\n\\nshortages of raw materials, including lumber, asphalt, \\n\\ncement, steel, and wallboard. The lack of available land \\n\\ncaused some homebuilders to start building smaller \\n\\nhomes or to move further into rural areas. Contacts in \\n\\nthe Pacific Northwest noted that bidding wars are com-\\n\\nmon for newly listed properties, and some homebuilders \\n\\nare delaying price quotes until completion of new homes \\n\\ndue to overall cost uncertainties. Demand for multifamily \\n\\nhomes also increased, although a few contacts noted \\n\\nthat projects in metropolitan areas had to be put on hold \\n\\ndue to increasing costs. Several contacts in California \\n\\nmentioned a backlog of permits due to COVID-related \\n\\nshutdowns in local governments.  \\n\\nConditions in the commercial real estate market were \\n\\nlargely unchanged. Demand for new office, retail, and \\n\\nhospitality space stayed muted with reports of high va-\\n\\ncancies and declining lease rates. However, demand for \\n\\nindustrial, warehouse and distribution spaces strength-\\n\\nened especially in the suburbs, and vacancy rates were \\n\\nnoted to be relatively low with lease rates either steady \\n\\nor rising. One contact in Southern California mentioned \\n\\nthat the continued pace for vaccinations has contributed \\n\\nto a slight pickup in demand for retail space, as people \\n\\nreturn to metropolitan areas in preparation of in-person \\n\\nwork. \\n\\nFinancial Institutions  \\nLending activity rose somewhat during the reporting \\n\\nperiod. Most new growth in loan origination was led by \\n\\ndemand for commercial and multifamily real estate. \\n\\nResidential mortgage and refinancing activity also con-\\n\\ntinued to be solid, while demand for auto loans and \\n\\ncredit cards held steady. However, contacts across the \\n\\nDistrict noted increased competition among financial \\n\\ninstitutions for new loans and deals, which led a few to \\n\\nraise concerns over deteriorating loan quality. Overall \\n\\nthough, banks reported low delinquency rates, ample \\n\\nliquidity, and high asset quality. Mergers and acquisitions \\n\\nactivity continued to increase, although one contact in \\n\\nSouthern California observed a decline in SPACs \\n\\n(special purpose acquisition companies) origination in \\n\\nrecent weeks. ■ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
